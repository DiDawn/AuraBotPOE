## Installation
### Environment
If your main account is an aura bot, and you are simply bored of manually following others, you can skip to [the next part](#download-python).

If you want to run the aura bot on another account to support you while you're playing,
you will need to set up a new machine. Since you cannot run multiple instances of Steam on the same machine,
you will either need to use another PC or a virtual machine to run Path of Exile (POE).
(If you don't know how to set up a virtual machine, you can follow [this guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/step-by-step-how-to-create-a-windows-11-vm-on-hyper-v-via/ba-p/3754100)).
Be sure to follow the instructions below on the machine where the bot will be run.
